As you all know, we deployed numerous fiber optics sensors (with different lengths) across different structure members to monitor the load responses of the model bridge. Since we have three model bridges this year, each with different sensor deployment strategies, the sensors' raw data are huge and hard to handle. For the ease of this exercise, the distributed strain data is preprocessed by us, and only some cleaned data from certain bridge members are presented here.\n",

Synchronizing times across all equipment make the comparison/plotting of different measurements possible. \n",
